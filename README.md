# Ada Uncommon Error: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada programming: division by zero.  Ada's exception handling mechanism is used to gracefully handle this situation, preventing program crashes.

The `bug.ada` file contains the code with the division by zero error, while `bugSolution.ada` shows how to correctly handle the exception.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Ada to maintain program stability and reliability.
